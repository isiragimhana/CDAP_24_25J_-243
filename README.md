RESEARCH 
QUESTIONS

What image processing techniques are most effective for accurate  identification of animal breeds ?​

How can advanced machine learning and deep learning models be utilized for animal details identification, and what performance metrics are best suited to evaluate their accuracy ?

solution

To accurately identify animal breeds, use deep learning-based models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNet, DenseNet, or EfficientNet. These models can automatically extract and classify features from animal images. Preprocess data through normalization, augmentation, and contrast enhancement techniques to improve model performance. Use semantic segmentation methods, like Mask R-CNN, to isolate animals from backgrounds for focused feature extraction.

For implementing machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify animal details, employ transfer learning with pre-trained models. Fine-tune these models on your dataset for higher accuracy. Integrate attention mechanisms or ensemble methods to enhance feature extraction and decision-making. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and IoU for segmentation tasks. Optimize inference time and model size for real-time applications.
